# finance-tracker

A simple finance tracker made in python using Pandas for reading and extracting data, and Matplotlib for plotting graphs, to showcase python skills
- Reads a CSV file of spending
- categorises expenses through a dictionary
- calculates how much spent on each category, and total spending
- tells the average spent per day, highest spending day
- plots a line graph for spenidng on each day, and a pie chart to show weightings of each categories
- outputs a summary report in the form of a txt file

# How to run
1. clone the repo
2. create a spending.csv file in the format of the example one in there already
3. run main.py

# Things I learned from doing this project
- Learned how to index and manipulate CSV files efficiently in Python using pandas
- Discovered built-in functions for grouping and summarising data, reducing the need for manual loops
- Practiced debugging and troubleshooting by analysing error messages and testing solutions iteratively
- Applied data structuring and categorisation to accurately track transactions and generate monthly summaries
